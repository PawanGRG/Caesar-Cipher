# Caesar Cipher
This was my first ever programming project, this program implements the Caesar cipher encryption and decryption techniques. It allows users to encrypt or decrypt messages using a specificed rotational value, users can also perform a brute force attach to decipher messages.

## Features

- Encryption: Encrypt messages by shifting characters using a rotational value.
- Decryption: Decrypt messages using the reverse shift of the rotational value.
- Brute Force: Perform a brute force attack to explore all possible shifts and decrypt messages.
- Input Validation: Validate user inputs for correct formatting and values.
- File Handling: Option to input messages from files for convenience.
